Match 3 game prototype

A match 3 gameplay prototype based on the below criteria:
1.Created a falling block mechanism for 3 colored blocks: Red, Blue, and Green. The system should is coded in such a way that new color blocks can be added dynamically.
2. Falling blocks have probability control.  e.g. Red block 50%, Blue block 20% and Green block 30%. In this example, Red would be filling up the board more than yellow and green.
3.No moves possible: A scenario where there is no match of 3 of any color, same tiles should jumble on the board. Created an animated effect for re-arrangement of the tiles on the board.
